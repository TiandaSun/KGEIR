       "CompletionResponse(text=\"Bulgarian political mythology is rich and diverse, reflecting the country's complex history, cultural heritage, and national identity. While it's challenging to provide an exhaustive list, I'll outline some recurring archetypes that appear in Bulgarian political myths:\\n\\n1. **The National Hero**: Figures like Vasil Levski, Hristo Botev, and Georgi Rakovski are revered as symbols of national resistance against Ottoman rule. They embody the values of patriotism, bravery, and self-sacrifice.\\n2. **The Wise Leader**: Archetypes like Khan Krum, Tsar Simeon I, and Prince Alexander Batenberg represent wise and just rulers who have guided Bulgaria through times of turmoil and transformation.\\n3. **The Martyr for Freedom**: This archetype is exemplified by figures like Stefan Stambolov, a politician who was assassinated in 1895, and Nikola Vaptsarov, a poet who was executed by the Communist authorities in 1942. They are celebrated as champions of freedom and democracy.\\n4. **The Traitor**: Characters like Vladislav III, also known as Vladislav the Coward, and Stefan Dushanov, a politician who collaborated with the Ottoman Empire, embody the negative archetype of treachery and betrayal of national interests.\\n5. **The Unifier**: Archetypes like Tsar Boris I, who united the Bulgarian state in the 9th century, and Prince Alexander Batenberg, who played a key role in Bulgaria's unification after the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), represent the idea of national unity and consolidation.\\n6. **The Protector**: Figures like Saint Demetrius of Thessalonica, the patron saint of the Bulgarian Army, and Saint Ivan Rilski, a medieval hermit who is revered as a protector of the nation, embody the archetype of protection and guardianship over the country and its people.\\n7. **The Anti-Imperialist**: Archetypes like Vasil Levski and Hristo Botev, who fought against Ottoman rule, and Georgi Dimitrov, a communist leader who resisted Nazi occupation during World War II, represent the struggle for national independence and sovereignty.\\n\\nThese recurring archetypes in Bulgarian political myths reflect the country's complex history, cultural heritage, and national identity.
